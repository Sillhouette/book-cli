# 8th Light Technical Assessment Code Submission

This is the repo that contains my code submission for the technical assessment at 8th light. It contains two main directories, the first is a procedural directory that contains a procedural approach and the second folder contains an object oriented approach, both of which are attempts at achieving the goals set out by 8th light.

#### A note to the reviewer(s)

While I believe that the procedural approach was the best, most logical approach to this particular challenge, I provided an object oriented solution as well because I know how valuable programming from an object oriented standpoint is, and I wanted to demonstrate my capabilities from both perspectives.

## Installation

Follow these easy steps to install and start the app:

### Set up the application

First, fork and clone this repository.

Then, change directories into the folder for the repo and run `npm install`

### Start the application

To start the application using the procedural approach run `node ./procedural/bookCli.js`

To start the application using the object oriented approach run `node ./object-oriented/cli.js`

### Testing the application

To run the tests use the command `npm test`
There are three test files, booksTests.js tests the procedural version of the code and the other two test their respective classes.
Note: The output from the running of the cli still gets printed to the console so you likely have to scroll up to see the results of the tests once they have been run

Thank you!
